# MCRTsim-fork
### MCRTsim
This repository is part of my National Science Council Research Scholarship project in Taiwan.

Currently, I am assisting in organizing the JavaDoc for the previous system MCRTsim.

After completing the JavaDoc, I will begin developing the criticality model for real-time systems.

The name of the new systems will named SimArt.

MCRTsim is an open-source simulation toolkit for real-time task scheduling and synchronization on multicore processors.

Bascially write the JavaDoc on MCRT-fork branch.
