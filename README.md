# MCRTsim-fork
### MCRTsim
This repository is part of my National Science Council Research Scholarship project in Taiwan.

I am currently working on organizing the JavaDoc for the original MCRTsim system.
After completing the JavaDoc, I will begin developing a criticality model for real-time systems.

The new system will be named <em>SimArt</em> (A Simulation Environment for Mixed-Criticality Real-Time Task Scheduling Algorithms).

MCRTsim is an open-source simulation toolkit for real-time task scheduling and synchronization on multicore processors.

I am primarily working on the JavaDoc in the MCRT-fork branch.
